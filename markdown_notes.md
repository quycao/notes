# Markdown Notes


## 1. Paragraph
Everything you write are just wrapped in paragraphs. You can separate paragraphs by leaving a line between them.


## 2. Headings
You can create headings with number of hashes # . The more the number of hashes the lesser the power of heading.

    # Main heading
    ## Sub heading


## 3. Links
Links are really important in documents and markdown’s syntax for links is great too
    I read a lot and also write some cool blogs. You can read [My blog](https://medium.com/itsjzt) here.


## 4. Images
Everyone loves to make their text visually appealing by adding high quality images. It’s just adding ! a link to make it an image.

## 5. Lists
Actually there are 2 types of list
- Un-ordered List: they are made by "-" character, example:
    - first item
        some text about it.
    - Second item
        some text also about it.
- Order List: Items are listed with some number or counting
    1. Hello this about me.
    2. I'm a great blogger.
    3. I write on medium.


## 6. Blockquote
Want to show some quotes or highlight some text to get users attention, then blockquote is what you need

## 7. Code
- You can write code samples in your markdown by using pair of `(upperticks)` you can write multi-line code with 3 pair of upperticks.
- If you have using some sort of code highlight then adding the language name after starting upper-ticks will provide you with highlighted code.
- Want to use a backtick in your Markdown text? Either escape it by including a backslash first, like \`, or put three backticks around the backtick to display it in code.

```bash
# ping on google server (bash script)
ping -t www.google.com
```


## 8. Bold text
If you want to bold the text use **Bold** or __bold__ whatever you prefer, I generally prefer to use stars for bold and underscores for italics.

**bold text denoting it's something important**

__another bold text__


## 9. Italic text
For italic text use single underscore _italic_ or star *italic* around the text.

*italic*

_italic_


## 10. Task Lists
- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item


## 11. Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column


## 12. Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
